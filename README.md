# POO_Reto_1

## 1. A basic, simple calculator.
Something you learn how to do as a kid (if you are lucky). Give it numbers, the operator, and it'll give you the answer.

## 2. Do you even know what a palindrome is? Find out here.
A palindrome is a word, phrase, etc, that will be the same whether you read it forward or backward- A real intelectual exercise, if you wanna create them. I can help you estimate if it really is a palindrome. Type the word, phrase, whatever, and it should tell you if it's exactly the same.

## 3. Memorizing all the prime numbers is hard.
But they are exigent numbers which makes them easier to find. Apart from 2 and 3, any other prime number can be written with the formula "6n + 1" or "6n â€“ 1". This code can save you doing such a complicate computation.

## 4. You could need this operation someday, or not.
Code that takes any consecutive pair in the array.

## 5. I ran out of ideas, but my teacher has not.
This is about finding cousin words. Somehow.
